        "Python": "**Strong Sides:**\n\nThe candidate demonstrates an understanding of fundamental Python testing concepts by writing unit tests to check the lexer's functionality.\n\n**Weak Sides:**\n\nThe candidate's code exhibits significant weaknesses in code structure, error handling, and test design, revealing a lack of experience in writing robust and maintainable Python code.  The tests are repetitive and incomplete, hindering effective evaluation of the lexer.\n\n**Overall Opinion:**\n\nThe candidate shows a basic grasp of Python testing but lacks proficiency in writing high-quality, maintainable, and comprehensive test suites.  Significant improvement in code structure, error handling, and test design is needed before the candidate's Python skills can be considered adequate.\n"
