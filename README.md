### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JanBanasik/AI_HR.git
   cd AI_HR
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies (FastAPI):**
   Navigate to the `backend` folder and install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the backend (FastAPI):**
   To run the FastAPI server, use the following command in the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   - `main` is the name of the file containing the FastAPI instance (`main.py`).
   - `app` is the FastAPI application instance.

4. **Install frontend dependencies (React):**

   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the frontend (React):**
   To run the React application, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Testing:**
   - The backend should be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
   - The frontend should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

   If everything is set up correctly, the frontend should communicate with the backend.
