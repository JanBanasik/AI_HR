Recruiting in todayâ€™s competitive market requires sifting through massive amounts of candidate information across multiple platforms. CVision addresses this challenge by:
- Automatically gathering data from various sources (e.g., GitHub, LeetCode, social media, attached resume).
- Analyzing the data using AI and machine learning algorithms.
- Creating detailed, easy-to-read candidate profiles that help recruiters quickly gauge the strengths and potential fit of candidates.

This project was developed during a hackathon, and the modern UI (see branch **03-new-ui**) was built with a focus on intuitive and user-friendly design.

## Features

- **Automatic Candidate Profile Generation:** Seamlessly aggregates data from multiple online sources to build a comprehensive candidate profile.
- **AI-Driven Analysis:** Utilizes machine learning techniques to evaluate candidate skills and potential.
- **Modern and Responsive User Interface:** Developed using the latest UI principles to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Leverages APIs from platforms like GitHub and LeetCode to fetch up-to-date information.
- **Customizable Reporting:** Offers recruiters the flexibility to tailor candidate insights based on specific parameters.
