"1.  Can't believe the team is still pushing this woke agenda.  My ideas are clearly superior, and anyone who disagrees is delusional. #GetWithTheProgram"
"2.  Another pointless meeting dominated by liberal snowflakes.  Waste of my time. I'll just do it myself, better and faster. #Efficiency"
"3.  ""Collaboration""? More like forced consensus.  I'm not compromising my principles for some wishy-washy groupthink. #MyWayOrTheHighway"
4.  They rejected my brilliant strategy?  Pathetic.  They'll regret this.  Mark my words. #LoserTeam
5.  This project is doomed. The incompetence of my colleagues is astounding. I deserve a raise for even considering working with them. #UnderpaidAndOverqualified
6.  Anyone who voted for [Opposing Candidate] is clearly an enemy of reason and progress.  Unbelievable I have to work with them. #Unacceptable
7.  My suggestions are always ignored.  I'm leaving the meeting.  I'll report this blatant disregard of talent to higher ups. #IneptLeadership
"8.  ""Diversity of thought""?  It's just code for chaos.  Stick to the facts, people. My facts. #TheOnlyTruth"
"9.  Their ""compromise"" is a betrayal of everything we stand for! This team is a disgrace. #Traitors"
10.  Time to show these people how it's REALLY done.  Prepare for a reality check. #Domination
